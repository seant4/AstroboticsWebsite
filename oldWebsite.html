    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <p> Astrobotics is a design team based out of the Joseph F.
    Ware Advanced Engineering Laboratory that competes in the
    NASA Robotic Mining Competition. We are a senior design team for
    mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. The team is
    currently comprised of 19 members: 13 seniors and 6 underclass
    volunteers. If you are a student at Virginia Tech and are interested
    in volunteering with team. </p>

      <h2> How the team works </h2>
      <p> The engineers operate on a one-year design cycle,
      designing and fabricating the robot in-house at Virginia
      Tech’s Ware Lab. The engineers are organized into two sub-teams;
      mechanical design and autonomy. </p>

        <h2> NASA RMC </h2>
        <h3> What is the RMC (Robotic Mining Competition)? </h3>
        <p> The NASA RMC is a design challenge for college teams
          based off of the current NASA mission of traveling to,
          and potentially inhabiting, Mars. Water is one of the most
          important factors for sustaining life, and it is theorized
          that water can be found in the form of icy gravel beneath
          the surface of Mars. The purpose of the RMC is for teams
          of college students to design and manufacture an autonomous
          Mars mining robot that is able to extract the aforementioned
          icy gravel. </p>

          <h2> Mechanical Sub-Team </h2>
          <p>This sub-team works on the design and manufacture of the
          robot and focuses on four main systems. If you're interested
          in volunteering for the team, </p>

          <h3> Locomotion </h3>
          <p> The locomotion system is what allows the robot to traverse
            the competition arena. Our team currently uses a tank treads
            design; however, there are other options that can be used as
            well. For many competition teams, wheels and treads are the
            most popular locomotion systems. </p>

         <div class="Home" >
          <h3> Mining </h3>
          <p> The primary goal of the NASA Robotic Mining Competition
            is to mine as much gravel as possible, so the mining system
            is one of the most important and complex systems on the robot.
            There are many different mining systems that are used by
            teams in the competition. This year, our team is using a bucket
            elevator system for mining. </p>
            <h3> Dumping </h3>
            <p> In addition to mining the material, the team is required
            to dump all collected material in a bin placed in the mining
            arena. In order to do this successfully, often times a separate
            dumping mechanism is required. Two of the most commonly used
            dumping systems are the pivoted dump body and the conveyor belt
            dumping system. This year, the team is using a pivoted dump
            body for the dumping system. </p>

           <div class="Home" >
            <h3> Controls </h3>
            <p> Controls is how the whole robot functions. It includes
              the analysis and use of sensors, motors, motor controllers,
              and batteries. By connecting these different parts together
              through the use of a microcontroller, the robot can be
              remotely controlled by a teleoperations system.</p>

          <div class="auto_sub_team">
          <h2> Autonomy Sub-Team </h2>
          <p> The autonomy sub-team is responsible for having the robot
            navigate autonomously through the competition arena. If you're
            interested in volunteering for the team </p>
            <h3> How does it work? </h3>
            <p> The team creates a path planning intelligence using
            two systems: a Pozyx, which provides orientation data based
            off of the starting location, and a lidar, which provides
            accurate obstacle data points with respect to the robot. When
            this data is given to the D* algorithm in Simulink, the result
            is a continuously updated path for the robot to travel so that
            it can avoid boulders and craters while crossing the
            obstacle field. </p>
