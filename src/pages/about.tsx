            <p>
              Astrobotics is a design team based out of the Joseph F. Ware
              Advanced Engineering Laboratory that competes in the NASA Robotic
              Mining Competition. We are a senior design team for mechanical,
              electrical, and computer engineering. The team is currently
              comprised of 19 members: 13 seniors and 6 underclass volunteers.
              If you are a student at Virginia Tech and are interested in
              volunteering with team.

          <Section title="How the team works">
            <p>
              The engineers operate on a one-year design cycle, designing and
              fabricating the robot in-house at Virginia Techâ€™s Ware Lab. The
              engineers are organized into two sub-teams; mechanical design and
              autonomy.

            <p>
              The team participates in multiple STEM based outreach activities
              throughout the year with a focus on hands-on activities. If you
              are interested in working with Astrobotics for an event.
